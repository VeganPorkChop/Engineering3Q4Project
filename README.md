* Week 4/24-31
 -Documentation just started and all the code functions individually except for the pid code. It, in concept, functions perfectly, but needs lots of tuning.
 -One problem we have is that the servos are off center, originally we thought about changing the set point of the PID function to accomidate, but instead of dealing with I we decided to level the servo instead and offset its degrees.
